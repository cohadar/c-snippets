# c-snippets
Various useful C snippets designed to be easily copy-pasted.

All useful code is contained in header files, .c files contain only tests.
This is NOT a library, but a copy-paste scrapbook.

## Some coding conventions
'this/self' variables are named 'o', o->data
Constructors are named ClassName_new
Destructors are named ClassName_delete
functions/methods that return object that needs to be free-d must have malloc in their name
No include directives inside header files!
